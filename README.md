# Capstone-1-Gravel-Shooters

Gravel Shooters 3D is an Augmented Reality Android app that aims to allow the user to select a particular color of gravel and point their device’s camera at the ground to “spread” the gravel themselves, virtually, in 1-sqft increments, until the desired portion of their yard is covered. At that point the app will calculate the amount of material (in tons) required, as well as the cost for delivery.
